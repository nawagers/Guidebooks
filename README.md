# Guidebooks

This project is for providing quality information in a format suitable for long distance hiking. It is built in conjuction with [ProfileMaker](https://github.com/nawagers/ProfileMaker) to generate elevation plots with trail mileages. You can find the data for each trail in a sub-folder such as [New England Trail](https://github.com/nawagers/Guidebooks/tree/master/New%20England%20Trail).

Inside each sub-folder the Processed Data folder contains relevant GPX files. Rendered Pages has the individually rendered pages (output from ProfileMaker). The Supplementary Pages folder contains additional pages located at the front, back, and throughout the guide. The supplementary pages are designed in Scribus and saved in its native format. Scribus is a free and open source project, giving access to nearly everyone who may want to contribute of view the raw pages. The top level of the trail folder will contain a pdf of the latest compiled version of the guide. The project will also have a number of .qgs files. These are map projects made in QGIS, a free and open source GIS tool.

The main project also contains PossibleProjects.xlsx, a spreadsheet of potential new projects to add in the future. Various guidelines and suggestions that apply to all projects are listed here.

If you have any issues or suggestions, feel free to file an [Issue](https://github.com/nawagers/Guidebooks/issues). If you'd like to contribute, please see CONTRIBUTING.md to get started.
