Overall size

Guidebooks are often stored inside resealable plastic bags to keep them dry and avoid abrasion. A quart size Ziploc bag measures approx 7" opening and 7 1/2" deep. The book will have thickness and additional room is need to insert and remove the book and bag sizes may vary between brands. The maximum recommended size is 5 1/4" x 6 1/4". If the book needs to be bigger, a gallon size bag measures around 10 1/2" x 10 3/4", but a standard sheet of paper (US) is 8 1/2" x 11" making it convenient to print two pages of size 5 1/2" x 8 1/2"
